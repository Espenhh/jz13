      <h3 class="first"><i class="icon-beer"></i> Freezing beers, great bands, awesome people</h3>

      <p>After a long day learning great new stuff at the Conference, we all need to chill out and have a nice, cold beer. We meet up at <a href="http://www.rockefeller.no">Rockefeller Music Hall</a> to chill out, mingle and listen to some great bands.</p>
      <p>In the main concert hall, we'll be joined by two to three great partner bands. Who they are are not yet desided, but judging from previous years, they will bring their best jam and rock the building</p>
      <p>In addition to the bands of our great <a href="#">partners</a>, we will book quite a few great bands. Previous years, we have been delighed to have great bands such as CC Cowboys, Honningbarna, Oslo Ess &amp; Turboneger. This year will be no different!</p>

      <h3><i class="icon-music"></i> Want to rock Rockefeller?</h3>

      <p>A great party is nothing without great bands! And any respectful IT-conference needs great geek-bands. That's why we want <strong>you</strong> up on the main stage!</p>
      <p>If your company has a great band, this is your opportunity to show yourself to the world. Just <a href="mailto:program@​java.​no">send us a small pitch,</a> including anything that makes you look good (pictures, sound-clips, videos), and we'll get in touch with you.</p>
