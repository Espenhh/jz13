      <h3 class="first"><i class="icon-beer"></i> Freezing beers, great bands, awesome people</h3>

      <p>After a long day learning great new stuff at the Conference, we all need to chill out and have a nice, cold beer. We meet up at <a href="http://www.rockefeller.no">Rockefeller Music Hall</a> to party, mingle and listen to some great bands.</p>
      <p>In the main concert hall, we'll be joined by some of <a href="#">our partners</a>' great bands. Who they are are not yet desided, but judging from previous years, they will bring their best jam and rock the building.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, we'll book a few bands that do that music-thing for a living. Previous years, we have been delighed to have great bands such as CC Cowboys, Honningbarna, Oslo Ess &amp; Turboneger. This year will be no different!</p>

      <h3><i class="icon-music"></i> Want to rock Rockefeller?</h3>

      <p>A great party is nothing without great bands! And any respectful IT-conference needs great geek-bands. That's why we want you up on the main stage!</p>
      <p>If your company has a great band, this is your opportunity to show yourself to the world. Just <a href="mailto:program@​java.​no">send us a small pitch</a>, including anything that makes you look good (pictures, sound-clips, videos), and we'll get in touch with you.</p>
