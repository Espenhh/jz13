      <h3 class="first"><i class="icon-globe"></i> The philosophy</h3>

      <p>The organiser of JavaZone is javaBin (the Norwegian Java User Group), an independent, non-profit organization. Its objective is to promote java expertise among its members, their companies and in the market. javaBin is based in Oslo, with local groups in SÃ¸rlandet, Stavanger, Bergen and Trondheim. The organisation of JavaZone is based on voluntary work. We believe that this makes our conference unique.</p>

      <p>JavaZone does not offer any classical sponsorships although we do have a partner program. However, the work which is done by the Program Committee in order to create the best possible agenda is completely independent. No one (including partners) can influence the outcome of the agenda for the conference. As a result of our independence, we have very limited resources when it comes to covering costs for our speakers. In the case of the conference ending in positive figures, we assure you that the money will be pushed back to the Java community.</p>

      <p>For this reason, we have a general policy on not reimbursing speakers. It is our impression that most speakers are backed by a company which in most cases will cover costs for traveling and accommodation. However, there are exceptional cases where we cover traveling and accommodation costs, or even parts of these for some speakers.</p>

      <p>We wish to be 100% open around our monetary policy. Also we want to be sure that all speakers receive the same information.</p>
